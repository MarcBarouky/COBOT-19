# COBOT-19

## Overview
This Project features an interactive robot capable of recognizing and responding to human greetings using MediaPipe's pose estimation, while also incorporating an object avoidance system and a function autonomous disinfection system.

## Feautres  

- **Human Greeting Recognition**: Utilizes MediaPipe's Hands model to recognize human gestures and determine greetings.  
- **Interactive Responses**: The robot responds to human greetings with the raising of a 3D printed hand controlled by a servo.  
- **Object Avoidance System**: Employs ultrasonic sensors and a collision detection algorithm to avoid collision with obstacles in its path.  
- **Autonomous Disinfection System**: The hydraulic system consists of flexible tubes with an connected to each other via joints and a pump, controlled by the main processor.

## Acknowledgments    
- The **MediaPipe** team for their gesture recognition library.  
- **Android Developers** for their well structured documentation.   
- **Dr. Gabriel Khoury** and **Dr. Joseph Bakouny** for their expertise and guidance throughout the development of this project.
